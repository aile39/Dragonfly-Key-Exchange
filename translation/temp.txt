The probability that one requires more than n iterations of the hunting-and-pecking loop to find an ECC PE is roughly (q/2p)^n and to find an FFC PE is roughly (q/p)^n, both of which rapidly approach zero (0) as n increases.  The security parameter, k, SHOULD be set sufficiently large such that the probability that finding the PE would take more than k iterations is sufficiently small (see Section 4).

ECCペアを探して見つけるときのhunting-and-peckingループの反復の回数は，およそ(q/2p)^nくらいで，FFC PEを見つけるときはおよそ(q/p)^nくらいで，両方とも，nが増加するとき急速に0に近づいていく．セキュリティパラメータkは，kの繰り返しよりも，PEが見つかる確率が十分に小さくなるように，十分に大きく設定されるべきだ．

Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the technique used to determine if the value is a quadratic residue modulo p blind the value with a random number so that the blinded value can take on all numbers between 1 and p-1 with equal probability while not changing its quadratic residuosity.
Determining the quadratic residue in a fashion that resists leakage of information is handled by flipping a coin and multiplying the blinded value by either a random quadratic residue or a random quadratic nonresidue and checking whether the multiplied value is a quadratic residue (qr) or a quadratic nonresidue (qnr) modulo p, respectively.
The random residue and nonresidue can be calculated prior to hunting and pecking by calculating the Legendre symbol on random values until they are found:
